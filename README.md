# Online Store

This project consists of the REST api for an online store using microservices architecture.

My goal whit this project is to use all knowledge that i have acquired over the course of 8 months in a self-taught way to create a rest-full amateur application for an online store.

## Microservices

* **Product-Service** microservice in charge of products management. [Commands and Endpoints](https://github.com/SirNoob97/OnlineStore/blob/master/product-service/README.md)
* **Auth-Service** microservice in charge of user authentication and authorization, as well as acting as the application gateway. [Commands and Endpoints](https://github.com/SirNoob97/OnlineStore/blob/master/auth-service/README.md)
* **Shopping-Service** microservice in charge of invoice management, to generate invoices it is necessary for this microservice to make requests to products-services, so it is also a client. [Commands and Endpoints](https://github.com/SirNoob97/OnlineStore/blob/master/shopping-service/README.md)

These will obtain their configuration from this repository through a centralized configuration service that will use the Spring Cloud Config Server dependency.

Eureka dependencies will be used for the discovery of all services.

Hystrix's will be used for monitoring thaks to Actuator and Admin Starter, which will provide the information generated by Actuator in a separate and more readable endpoint.

Cloud Gateway to have a single acces endpoint.

Spring Security and JWT for the users authentication and authorization.

### Dependencies

* Spring Boot Starter Web, Web Flux, JPA, R2DBC, Validation, Actuator, Security.
