# Online Store

This project consists of the REST api for an online store using microservices architecture.

My goal whit this project is to use all knowledge that i have acquired over the course of 7 months in a serlf-taught way to create what in my current perception is a rest-full professional application or at least try it.

### Dependencies to use

  * Spring Boot Starter Web, JPA, Validation, Actuator, Security.
  * Spring Cloud Starter Config, Netflix Eureka Client and Server, Sleuth, Config Server, Gateway, Openfeign, Netflix Hystrix and Dashboard.
  * H2.
  * Lombok(maybe).
  * Codecentric Admin Starter Client and Server.

The project will consists of three microservices connected from the consumer thaks to Openfeign:
  * Customers
  * Products
  * Invoices(Consumer)



These will obtain their configuration from this repository through a centralized configuration service that will use the Spring Cloud Config Server dependency.

Eureka dependencies will be used for the discovery of all services.

Hystrix's will be used for monitoring thaks to Actuator and Admin Starter, which will provide the information generated by Actuator in a separate and more readable endpoint.

Cloud Gateway tho have a single acces endpoint.

Spring Security for the authentication and authorization of the app.

These will be the initial dependencies for the app, I'll leave the microservices security for the end, to which I'll add JWT dependencies, for the official database I'll use Postgres when I make sure that the crud operations of the microservices work correctly.

---
This project will only be to demonstrate the knowledge that I have acquired so far this year.

Once the security is finished, I'll finish the development of the app, because the Gateway greatly affects the performance of my laptop so I'll not be able to fully test the app.

I could omit this service but i don't whant that, my idea is try to create an application(even if it's small) realistic or at least as i think it is a real application ready for a business environment.
